# Next Steps for January 13, 2020



## Optional

1. If you want, and you have been able to get yourself set up, you can work through the materials in Chs. 2 and 3 of Healey. To follow along and get the most out of this material please do the following. 

- Use RStudio to open the file dataviz.Rproj in the subfolder DMJN328/dataviz/

- Or, double-click on the file dataviz.Rproj in the subfolder.

- If you have been able to clone my course repository you should see some .R files like "02_get_started.R" Open this file. If you haven't been able to clone my course repository with the updates that I have added, you won't have access to these files. You'll have to get them in a slightly hacky way. 

  - Visit https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/tree/master/dataviz and click on '02_get_started.R' Right-click on "Raw" and select "Save Link As". Save this file In the dataviz subfolder. Then open it with RStudio.

- Make a new script file using "File > New R Script" and work through the text, typing the code commands in Ch. 2 and then Ch. 3, and executing each line (command-Return on macs, control-enter on PCs). If you get stuck, copy and paste the commands you need from the master file. 

- When you are done, save this script file in the same folder with a meaningful name like "02_get_started_my_copy.R" 

- Repeat with the file for Ch. 3 'make_a_plot.R'

  - If you need to download it directly from the course page, go to https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/tree/master/dataviz and click on '03_make_a_plot.R', click on "Raw" and select "Save Link As". Save this file in the dataviz subfolder and open with RStudio

## Required

1. As far as I can tell, everybody is set up to start working on the "Learn R for Journalists" course, as scheduled on Wednesday. It's a bit of a shame to have to skip the optional material in Step 1 (Healey), but all of the material will be covered again, so I think it's best to forge on. 

   Here is the most user friendly way to get follow along with the videos. 

- In the course folder, you will find a folder called "learnr_journalism". In that folder, are subfolders for each chapter of the course. Open "learnr_chapter-1-master"There, you will find "learn-chapter-1.Rproj". Open this file with RStudio or double-click it. 

  ![](https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/raw/master/images/learnr_chapter_1_project_image.png)

- Open the file "intro_to_r/intro_to_r.R". This is the code that goes along with the video "Introduction to R". Use this file as a support for you as you watch the video.

  ![](https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/raw/master/images/file_intro_to_r.png)

- Note: Please delete the line that asks you to set a working directory. `setwd("~/projects/learn-r-journalism")` If you accidentally run this line, close down RStudio, re-open it with the 
  learn-chapter-1.Rproj" to reset the working directory to be where we want it to be. 

- Make a new R file for yourself "File > New R Script". Use this R script and try to type along with the video. If you get stuck, cut and paste what you need from the file "intro_to_r.R". When you are done, save this something like "Intro_r_my_copy.R"

After completing this video, do the same for the video "Data Structures in R"

- Open the file "intial_exploration/intial_exploration.R" and use this as your master file for the video "Data Structures in R". Again, try to follow along with the video, typing the code as best you can.

## Using the Mac Lab computers

If some of you have had issues with your personal computers, you are more than welcome to use the computers in the Mac lab. All of the necessary software has been installed on those computers. The only downside is that you need to clone (download) the course folders and files each time you use the computer.

To do this you need to use GitHub Desktop.

1. Sign into GitHub Desktop

2. Select Clone Local Repository.

   ![](https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/raw/master/images/clone_repository.png)

   3. Select the repository to clone. Note, your screen will look a little bit different. Choose the path where you want to store the files. If you are working on the Mac computers, you can store this anywhere.

From there, you should have all the cnecessary course files and folders on the computer you are working on. The only thing that you should do is backup your work. The way to do that is to go to the main GitHub Desktop screen and you should see a list of new or modified files like this:

![](https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/raw/master/images/changed_files.png)

1. Make a commit of these changes by giving a title and a summary. You can commit these changes maybe with the date of your work. Hit "Commit. "

   ![](https://github.com/sjkiss/DMJN328/raw/master/images/commit_to_master.png)

2. Then push these changes to your online repository.
