# Causation
1. Luck
2. Correlation
3. Other explanations 

# Correlation

# Correlation

# Correlation
Correlation does not = causation, but correlation always is necessary for causation. 

!["Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there';"](/Users/skiss/OneDrive - Wilfrid Laurier University/Courses/DMJN328/Lecture_Notes/mar_30/images/xkcd.png)

# Research Designs
1. A particular way of gathering data to test hypotheses
2. Each have particular advantages and disadvantages
    1. Cross-sectional
    2. Experiments

# Research Designs
## Cross-sectional
1. take a single snapshot of some phenonenon at a time
	- example: surveys
2. Very good at establishing correlations
3. Can be good at controlling for other explanations
4. Terrible at assessing causation.

## Cross-sectional
> Researchers find fewer depressive symptoms in dark-chocolate eaters
> Out of 13,000 people they surveyed, about 7.6 per cent overall said they felt depressive symptoms, while only 1.5 per cent of chocolate-eaters in that group reported feeling those symptoms.

# Research designs
## Cross-sectional

# Research designs
## Cross-sectional
2. What are the possible causal interpretations of these data?
    - eating chocolate might make you feel less depressed ( x might cause y)
    - being depressed might cause you to eat chocolate (y might cause x)
    - Something else might cause depression *and* a propensity to eat chocolate (e.g. low levels of education, stressful job might cause both x and y)
    - x and y relationship might actually be luck
        - large sample size, low p-values of findings are supposed to guard against this, but remember the jelly bean comic and publication bias

# Research Designs
## Experiments
1. Technical name is Randomized Control Trial (RCT)
2. Seen as gold standard
3. Basic logic is to distinguish between causal models
    - Randomly assign participants to a *treatment* group that gets the hypothesized cause or a *control* group that does not
    - in theory treatments are the only thing that distinguish random from control groups

# Research Designs
## Experiments

Have their own problems. 

1. hard to do for really interesting questions, expensive
    - How do you test the effects of poverty on future life happiness with an experiment
2. Can you really replicate the real world in a lab?

# Research Designs
## Experiments

There are some variations on experiments at a large scale

1.  Quasi-experiments
    - take advantage of natural variation in the world
    - the Richmond homicide example and the Hamilton pub closing time examples are great examples of these.

# Research Designs
## Experiments
- Williams (1986)[^1]
     - researchers studied the impact of the introduction of television on three remote communities
     - one had no television, two others did. 
     - Violence in playgrounds increased

# Falsification

- Falsification, not proof
- scientific explanations are always uncertain
- good because it encourages debate, criticism and avoids dogma and deference to authority
