Course Description
==================

This course builds on material in DMJN208, developing students’ facility
withquantitative research methods used in journalism and media research.
Studentslearn to work with and critically assess quantitative
information, with a particular emphasis on polls and scientific studies.
The course covers basic and intermediate statistical concepts and
calculations. Potential topics include survey research design and
interpretation, causation, the central limit theorem,standard error,
statistical significance and confidence intervals.

Pep Talk
--------

Learning R can be tough; Lord knows I struggled to learn it. But
learning anything is always hard. But when you have really learned it.
Wow, there is no better feeling in the world. And once you have learned
even just a few basic things in R you - and others - will be absolutely
amazed at what you can accomplish. One of the leaders in developing R,
Hadley Wickham, had this to say about frustration and learning to code
and R.

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and
> think,“Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid," or, “I’m not made out to
> program." But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets
> frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R
> code.It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to
> everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just
> take abreak, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

There will be moments where you want to bash your head against the desk.
Don’t. Ask me for help any way (e.g. personally, e-mail,
mylearningspace). Take a break. Walk around. Go get a drink. Watch cat
videos on YouTube fora few minutes then just come back and take a break.
You. can. do. this... And when you’re done, you will be blown away....
